This is the template to solve almost all binary search problems.




left, right = [1...n] || [0...len(Arr)-1] //depends upon ques requirement
while left < right:
     mid = left + (right - left)//2 //to avoid overflow when inputs are of range 2^31
     if someCondition(mid):
        right = mid        // ans lies on left side
     else:
        low = mid + 1    //  ans lies on right side
return left/left - 1    // depends upon question where k is minimized




// if there is a question where arr is given and m is given
// ex - arr = [1,2,4,3,7] k = 2
// it may be variation of ship capacity/koko banana problem
